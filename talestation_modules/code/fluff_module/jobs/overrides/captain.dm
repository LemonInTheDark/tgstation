		be pumped into the helmet, all of highly-endangered flowers. A bespoke Tralex mechanical clock has been placed \
		in the wrist, and the Magnate package comes with carbon-fibre cufflinks to wear underneath. \
		My God, it even has a granite trim. The double-classified paint that's been painstakingly applied to the hull \
		provides protection against shock, fire, and the strongest acids. Onboard systems employ meta-positronic learning \
		and bluespace processing to allow for a wide array of onboard modules to be supported, and only the best actuators \
