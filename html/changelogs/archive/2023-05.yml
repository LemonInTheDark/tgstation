      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!

  - bugfix: North Star's shields now regenerate integrity over time
  Ryll/Shaps:
  - balance: Holding someone at gunpoint now requires both the shooter and the victim
      to hold still for half a second before activating, so you can't hold-up people
      fleeing or fighting you. After that, it will briefly immobilize the both of
      you, 0.75 seconds if adjacent, or half that if you're two tiles away. Nuke ops
      are immune to the immobilization, since they're ready to die anyways.

      function to their own preferences file (probably for bandwidth reasons?) you
      should uncomment this or add it to your config somehow.
  - config: Server operators are also able to set the cooldown between requests to
      download the JSON Preferences file via the 'SECONDS_COOLDOWN_FOR_PREFERENCES_EXPORT'
      config option.
  - rscadd: North Star's captain's office has been expanded! It now includes a sitting
