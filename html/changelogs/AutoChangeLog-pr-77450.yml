changes:
  - bugfix: "Fixed fired foam darts, gumballs and (harmless) lollipops being embeddable."
  - bugfix: "Projectiles that should embed while being reusable will now do so correctly, actually embedding the reusable casing instead of a shrapnel."
  - balance: "Arrows are generally more likely to embed now, except for blazing ones, that kind of just blaze."
  - qol: "the quiver storage now uses numerical stacking (like botany and ore bags, or the RPED, for example)."
